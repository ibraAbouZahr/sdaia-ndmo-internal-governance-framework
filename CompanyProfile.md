## 🌐 Impact on the Saudi Data Ecosystem

NDMO plays a pivotal role in:

- Increasing transparency and public trust
- Boosting the Saudi economy through data reusability
- Enabling secure sharing of data across government platforms
- Preparing government systems for AI integration via clean, classified data

## 🚧 Governance Challenge (Scenario Basis for Project)

As Saudi Arabia accelerates toward a **data-driven public sector**, NDMO must support a growing number of government entities integrating with national platforms. A consistent internal data governance plan is needed to:

- Clearly define roles and responsibilities
- Enforce classification of internal documentation and metadata
- Standardize data retention practices
- Ensure strict access controls

This mock project simulates how NDMO might document and manage this governance structure internally, serving as a blueprint or training resource.
