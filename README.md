# Mock Data Governance Framework for SDAIA / NDMO

This project presents a simulated data governance framework for the **National Data Management Office (NDMO)**, part of the **Saudi Data and AI Authority (SDAIA)**.

It demonstrates how data governance can be applied in a public sector environment, using best practices from **DAMA-DMBOK** and the **Saudi National Data Governance Framework**.
